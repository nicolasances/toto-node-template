# Deploying this Microservice on AWS

This guide will help you setup this microservice to deploy it to AWS. <br>

AWS Options: 
* **AWS Sandbox** - [Follow this guide](./sandbox/main.md) - allows you to deploy to a sandbox environment where you have restrictions (e.g. no possibility to create IAM Users, etc.. )
* **AWS Owner** - deploy to an AWS account where you are the owner and thus have full permissions and autonomy to operate.
